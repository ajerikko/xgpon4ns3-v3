The NS-3 XG-PON module v1 and v2 were the result of the development effort carried out by many people from UCC (University College Cork) and TCD (Trinity College Dublin). The main source code contributors are Xiuchao Wu (xw2@cs.ucc.ie), Jerome Arokkiam, and Pedro Alvarez (pinheirp@tcd.ie).

v3 of the XG-PON module was refactored from the v2 by Jerome Arokkiam to work with ns-3.35 in 2022
